# Handwritten Digit Recognition Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the Handwritten Digit Recognition project, which aims to accurately classify handwritten digits using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes the famous MNIST dataset, which consists of a large collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data), which is available on Kaggle. It contains a training set of 42,000 labeled images and a test set of 28,000 unlabeled images.

## Project Workflow

The project workflow can be summarized as follows:

  - Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the dataset.
  - Data Visualization: Explore the dataset through visualizations.
  - Model Building: Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for digit recognition.
  - Model Training: Train the CNN model using the training dataset.
  - Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset.
  - Accuracy Estimation: Estimate the model's accuracy using various appropriate methods.
  - Model Optimization: Refactor, optimize, and modify the model to improve accuracy.
  - Data Augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training dataset.
  - Final Model Training: Retrain the model using the augmented dataset.
  - Model Evaluation: Re-evaluate the optimized model on the validation dataset.
  - Confusion Matrix: Generate and analyze the confusion matrix to assess the model's performance.
  - Classification Report: Generate a classification report to evaluate precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
  - Prediction on Test Data: Make predictions on the test dataset using the trained model.
  - Sample Image Prediction: Load and preprocess a sample image, and predict the corresponding digit.
  - Label Interpretation: Convert the predicted label to a human-readable name.
